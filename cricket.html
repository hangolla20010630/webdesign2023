                                        Featuring two teams of eleven players each, cricket is a team sport. A flat, 20.12 m (22 yards) long strip
                                        of land known as a pitch sits in the middle of the roughly oval grass field where the bat and ball game is
                                        played. A wicket is a group of wooden stumps that are located at each end of the playing area. Be aware
                                        that the pitch itself is frequently used as the term "wicket," which can be somewhat misleading. A firm,
                                        fist-sized leather ball with a cork centre is thrown from one wicket to the other by a member of the
                                        fielding team. Before the batsman from the opposite team, who uses a wooden cricket bat to protect the
                                        wicket from the ball, the ball typically bounces once before reaching him. A second batsman (the
                                        "non-striker") who has been standing inactively close to the bowler's wicket can then exchange ends with
                                        the batsman by running between the wickets in order to score runs. The remaining members of the bowlers'
                                        squad are fielders who are positioned in various spots all around the oval. For many years, cricket has
                                        been a recognised team sport.

                                        The majority of its followers are current and past Commonwealth members, where it got its modern form's start. Cricket is by far the most well-liked sport in certain South Asian nations, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. In addition to these nations, cricket is a popular sport in England and Wales, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and the English-speaking Caribbean nations collectively known as the West Indies. The Netherlands, Kenya, Nepal, and Argentina are just a few examples of the diverse nations that host well-established amateur club events.

                                        Cricket is thought to have started out as a kid's game in the southeast counties of England. The word "cricket" for the sport is derived from the Old English word "cryce," which denotes a stick. Because the scorer used to notch tally sticks to count the amount of runs at the time, runs were referred to as "notches" during that era. The sport had a low-key following for a considerable amount of time before it began to spread outside of England at the turn of the century.

                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        Cricket was adopted as England's national sport in the 18th century, and the 52nd English cricket season, which began in 1748, is the oldest season of the game that is known to have been played. This popularity allowed cricket to finally find a home in the hearts of its fans. The first international tour of English players took place in 1859, and the two decades leading up to World War I are referred to as the "Golden Age of Cricket" since they saw a number of notable matches and the development of many outstanding players. The first-ever Test match between England and Australia was contested at the MCC Ground in 1876â€“1877, and it was the moment the rivalry gave rise to The Ashes Series in 1882.

                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        During the 20th century, the popularity of Test cricket grew throughout the world, and countries including
                                        Bangladesh, West Indies, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe began to play this format. 
                                        A new version of cricket limited overs was launched in 1963 by English counties.

                                        In 1971, the first limited-overs international tournament was held, and in 1975, the first such World Cup.
                                        The sport immediately benefited from the introduction of a new limited-overs format in the twenty-first
                                        century, which drew large crowds of spectators and participants.

                                        The fundamental objective of the game is to outscore your opponent by scoring more runs by hitting fours, sixes, and sprinting between the wickets to win the game.

                                        Although a cricket pitch is typically slightly oval, a circular field is thought to be the ideal one. Its
                                        diameter ranges from 137 to 150 metres. The playing area is specified as a minimum of 137.16m from
                                        boundary to boundary square of the pitch under the ICC Test Match Standard Playing Conditions (October
                                        2014) Law 19.1, with the shorter of the two square boundaries being a minimum of 59.43m. The pitch's
                                        straight boundary is at least 64 metres wide at both ends. Distances are gauged from the pitch's centre
                                        Boundaries cannot extend farther than 82.29 metres from the pitch's centre.

                                        A striker must hit the ball and sprint to the other end of the pitch while his non-striking partner
                                        sprints to his end in order to score a run. Both runners must make contact with the ground behind the
                                        popping crease with either their bats or their bodies for a run to be recorded. The batsman may double
                                        back to score two or more runs if the striker smashes the ball sufficiently enough. Running between
                                        wickets is the term for this. There is no regulation requiring the batsman to run after striking the ball,
                                        though. If the batsmen score an odd number of runs, they will have switched ends and, unless the most
                                        recent ball signals the end of an over, their roles as striker and non-striker will be reversed for the
                                        next ball. The closest batter is run out if a fielder uses the ball to knock the bails off the stumps while no one is grounded behind the closest popping crease. Four runs are scored if the ball crosses the boundary, or six if it doesn't bounce.
